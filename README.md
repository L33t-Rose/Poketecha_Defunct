# Poketecha_Remade
This is a remake of an old project using modern Javascript. Uses HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JS for now. This is using the [PokeApi](https://pokeapi.co/) to display general information of a Pokemon and the moves it can learn.

# Changes
Before this project was just a one pager with a megolith function which was VERY innefficent (The [old repo](https://github.com/L33t-Rose/poketecha) is still there) and would take forever to get data. Now using Async-Await (God Bless Promises) it only takes little time to get data from a server.

# Side Notes
This is still just a WIP. I plan to add more stuff and make some drastic UI changes sooner or later.

# Thoughts on this project
Yikes this was a fail in my opinion. I genuinely had a good idea but the execution was horrible. Trying to work on this was horrible! Using just vanilla js was horrible and honestly annoying. Most of my time creating this was working on the CSS which makes me realize I SUCK at writing CSS. 

Also, writing Vanilla JS is so mundane. Most of my code is just me fetching the element just to add an EventListener to it. 
In additon, my method of fetching data was super inefficent. Relegating my fetches to the client-side was super stupid and way too gimicky since I decided to use Asynchrous Async calls to get all my data. While cool at first after testing it out I realized it took way too long to fetch my data and format it. It's clear that i'm gonna need a better way of fetching data. 


# What's next
I desperately need to try out a javascript framework. Writing in vanilla HTML, CSS, & JS is so ANNOYING. I would probably use Svelte
