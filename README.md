# Poketecha_Remade
This is a remake of an old project using modern Javascript. Uses HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JS for now. This is using the [PokeApi](https://pokeapi.co/) to display general information of a Pokemon and the moves it can learn.

# Changes
Before this project was just a one pager with a megolith function which was VERY innefficent (The [old repo](https://github.com/L33t-Rose/poketecha) is still there) and would take forever to get data. Now using Async-Await (God Bless Promises) it only takes little time to get data from a server.

# Side Notes
This is still just a WIP. I plan to add more stuff and make some drastic UI changes sooner or later.
