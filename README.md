# Poketecha_Remade
This is a remake of an old project using modern Javascript. Uses HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JS for now.

# Changes
Before this project was just a one pager which would take forever to get the data. Now using Async (God Bless Promises) it only takes little time to get data from a server.

# Side Notes
This is still just a WIP. I plan to add more stuff and make some drastic changes sooner or later.
