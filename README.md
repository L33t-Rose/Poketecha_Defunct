# PokeTecha Remake

This is a re-remake of a personal project called PokeTecha. In essence, PokeTecha was originally a website I created that would simply just show the moves of a pokemon. It holds a great amount of lvoe in my heart because I created when I was a beginner.

# But why call it a re-remake?

This isn't my first rodeo trying to re-create PokeTecha. I had originally only done it HTML, CSS, and JS... and boy was it a failure. Not only did it look ugly, it was barely functional and took forever just to show moves. You can check out the original in the "master" branch. Ashamed of the end product I scrapped and realized that I desperately need to learn a better way of creating websites.
